Hello! I am Alize Jackson and I chose to do the quiz show project!

I ran into a lot of problems working on this project and at the end, I was not able to figure out the issues. 

First issue was the images: I couldn't figure out how to get the images to chnage after clicking the submit button
despite looking through different guides, tutorials, and even asking the professor for help. Nothing worked. So the quiz
is stuck with the one image that worked since it was on the HTML page.

Second issue was the alerts I wanted to show up after selecting the correct answer. This is what I typed but it wouldn't work.
    if (answer == "Dr.Frankenstein's Monster") {
      alert("Correct! Her name is Frankie Stein, the daughter of Frankenstein's monster!");
    } else if (answer == "Vampire") {
      alert("Correct! Her name is Draculaura, the adopted daughter of Dracula!");
    } else if (answer == "Werewolf") {
      alert("Correct! Her name is Clawdeen Wolf, the daughter of the Werewolf!");
    } else if (answer == "Sea monster") {
      alert("Correct! Her name is Lagoona Blue, the daughter of the sea monster and a sea nymph!");
    } else if (answer == "Mummy") {
      alert("Correct! Her name is Cleo De Nile, the royal daughter of the Mummy!");
    } else {
      alert("Incorrect!");
    }
    
Third issue was the score keeping. It worked at first, but for some reason, it stopped keeping score and the score always
remains at 0/5 at the end of the quiz.

I checked my error logs and nothing was popping up to show if I inputted something wrong or not.
I really did try on this project and I was actually looking forward to completing this in a way that satisfied me but
everything I tried to fix it didn't work, so I sadly give up and just turned in what I did have that worked.
