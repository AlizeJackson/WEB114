    <h1>Week 3 Project</h1>
    <h3><b>Questions</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.</li>
            <li>When comparing values,  in what data type is the result stored?</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Answers</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A situation where you would need to create an "if" statement would be when you are trying to filter out wrong
            and incorrect infomation. For example, you create a prompt that is looking for a certain, exact answer and you can 
            set it to show that the information you inputted was incorrect and to fix it.</li>
            <li>When comparing values, the date type the result is stored is the boolean value, showing whether it's true
            or false.</li>
        </ol>

        //*Spending Prompt*//
        let total = parseInt(prompt ("How much did you spend?"));
        //*Confirm Total*//
        let confirmed = confirm("$" + total + " in total? Click OK to continue!");
        
        //*If Prompt*//
        if (total < 50) {
            alert("No discount. :("); 
            //*No alert shows up for 50, since the instructions did not
            //state this equation to be less than or equal to fifty.*//
        }
        if (total >= 75) {
            alert("10% off. Not bad."); 
            //*This equations is conflicting with the 100 since they are both
            //greater thans. When the alert pops up after entering 200, 
            //it shows both 10% off and 20% off.*//
        }
        if (total >= 100) {
            alert("20% off. Ok, but could be better."); 
            //*The instructions states that 100 >= 100 and will be 20% off but it's not.*//
